# WP Growl
Show your WordPress admin notices in a growlike / better way, and snooze them whenever you see fit.

This WordPress plug-in aims to make admin notices more colorful and noticable so they are really an addition to your admin. 

In addition to making them more noticable WP Growl also makes it possible to snooze notices for you so you can really keep focus on the work you should do now.

And last but not least, WP Growl is here to fight those annoying notices being abused for advertising! We try to hide any notices being used by plug-ins. 

If you notice any abuse or want to get involved visit the [WP Growl GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/DannyvanHolten/wp-growl-notifications)

## Getting started

The plugin is available from the [WordPress plugin repository](http://www.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-growl-notifications)

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-growl-notifications` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->Plugin Name screen to configure the plugin
4. (Make your instructions match the desired user flow for activating and installing your plugin. Include any steps that might be needed for explanatory purposes)

You can also install WP Growl trough composer

`composer require dannyvanholten/wp-growl-notifications`

or if you make use of WPackagist

`composer require wpackagist/wp-growl-notifications`

## Getting involved

Want to get involved and improve WP Growl? Fork this repo and whenever you have something just make a pull request. After review we might add it to the [WP Growl GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/DannyvanHolten/wp-growl-notifications)

We know there's probably still a couple of plug-ins not compatible with WP Growl. And we would love to hear so if that's the case.

If a plug-in is not compatible with WP Growl we will try to fix this within WP Growl. Unfortunately there are a lot of plug-ins making abuse of the admin notices and thus we cannot always fix these.

If 3rd partys wrongly use these notifications we ask you to notify them on their GitHub repo's / WordPress plugin support page. If we render the plug-in important enought we might try to fix it for them and make a pull request to their GitHub repo if available.
