# WP Growl
Show your WordPress admin notices in a growlike / better way, and snooze them whenever you see fit.

## Getting started

The plugin is available from the wordpress repo at link
You can also install WP Growl trough composer

`composer require dannyvanholten/wp-growl`

or if you make use of WPackagist

`composer require wpackagist/wp-growl`

## Getting involved

Want to get involved and improve WP Growl? Fork this repo and whenever you have something just make a pull request. After review we might add it to this repo.

We know there's probably still a couple of plug-ins not compatible with WP Growl. And we would love to hear so if that's the case.

If a plug-in is not compatible with WP Growl we will try to fix this within WP Growl. Unfortunately there are a lot of plug-ins making abuse of the admin notices and thus we cannot always fix these.

If 3rd partys wrongly use these notifications we ask you to notify them on their GitHub repo's / WordPress plugin support page. If we render the plug-in important enought we might try to fix it for them and make a pull request to their GitHub repo if available.

## Getting ahead

As WordPress & WP Growl are continuously in development we like to take a look ahead together for what's coming. If you want to get involved developing WP Growl you can ask us if you can implement some of the features yourself.

- Add a button to your profile page to reset snoozed notices.
- Add support for WP Rocket
- Add support for W3 Total Cache
- Improve support for WPML
